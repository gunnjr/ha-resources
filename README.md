# Home Assistant Resources

This repository collects various Home Assistant-related artifacts that I use and share with the community.

The focus is on being **self-documenting**:

- Each folder owns its own lightweight documentation (e.g. local `README.md` or `INDEX.md`).
- The top-level README stays minimal so it does not need constant updates.

## What lives here

Typical content you may find in this repo:

- Blueprints for specific devices or patterns.
- Zigbee device research (signatures, logs, quirks notes).
- Shell scripts and small tooling around Home Assistant (e.g., log helpers).
- Documentation and how-tos related to ZHA, Zigbee, hardening, and operations.

For more detail about how this repo evolves over time, see `BUILD_PLAN.md`.
