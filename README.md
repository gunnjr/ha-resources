# Home Assistant Resources

A collection of Home Assistant blueprints, Zigbee device research, and utility tools. This repository exists because I often create resources for my own setup that others might find helpful—so I’m sharing them here. Some items are polished, others are exploratory, but all are provided openly in case they’re useful.

Contributions, fixes, and improvements are welcome.

## Repository Structure

This repo follows a **self-documenting** layout. Each top-level directory includes its own README or explanatory files.

- **[ha-assets/](ha-assets/)** – Blueprints, quirks, and other Home Assistant artifacts intended for direct use.
- **[research/](research/)** – Device research, behavior analysis, logs, reverse‑engineering notes, and supporting documentation.
- **[tools/](tools/)** – Utility scripts for testing, logging, Zigbee event capture, repository maintenance, and other workflows.
- **[docs/](docs/)** – Guides, references, design documents, and build plans.

See each directory’s README for details.

## Philosophy

The repo is organized to minimize churn. Files live where they make the most sense, and folder-level documentation explains the rest. This keeps the top-level README short and evergreen.

See **[BUILD_PLAN.md](docs/BUILD_PLAN.md)** for the full design philosophy.
