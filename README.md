## Repository Philosophy

This repo follows a **self-documenting structure** where directory names and local README files explain their contents. This keeps the main README stable and avoids massive tables that require constant updates.

See [BUILD_PLAN.md](BUILD_PLAN.md) for the design philosophy and build-out plan.
